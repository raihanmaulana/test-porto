## 🏁 Next + Tailwind Starter Kit

Kickstart your development and save extra hours on your next project. This template is simply built because I am tired of repeating my dev setup. 

### 📦 Requirements

First, click on the button on top of the repo called "Use this template", or copy the following code:

```bash
gh repo create new-project --public --template msafdev/starter-kit
```

Then, install everything:

```bash
bun install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

Now, your template is ready to be used.

### 🚦 To Do

- [x] Add CSS variables
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add more features and branches

#### Disclaimer

The project uses *Next.js*, *TailwindCSS*, *shadcn-ui*, and *Typescript*.
